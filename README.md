## Current Status
### [Winter 2025 Task List](https://github.com/byui-cse397/2025WinCSE397PCP_RecSrv/issues/2)

## To Do - GitHub Setup
- Add branch protection rules to prevent changes being commited directly to main (must make branches for each issue/task, then merge)
- Could also change pull request requirements (must have 2 members review work, only certain people can close, etc)

- ## Future Work
This project will also be worked on by future CSE397 students. Code and documentation for this project will be uploaded and updated within this repository.
